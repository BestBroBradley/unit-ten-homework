Team Profie Builder

In this program, a user can dynamically generate an HTML page with information about their current team members, including a manager, any number of engineers, and any number of interns.

The user can also include useful information regarding each of the employees, such as:

-Email
-ID
-GitHub username (Engineers only)
-Current school (Interns only)

This is a useful tool for anyone who wants to make a quick profile of a team, and could be easily scaled to include different types of teams.
